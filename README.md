Repository for CSC415 Hello World Project.

My name is Dennis Mamrenko and this is my last semester at Murray State. I hope to do well and learn a lot in my last few months here. I hope to find work as quickly as I can after I graduate, but I am still exploring my interests in the software development industry.
